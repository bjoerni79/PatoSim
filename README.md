# RiscVSim
The goal of this project is simulating a RISC-V hart based on .NET Core 3.1 

## Architecture
The project uses .NET Core 3.1 and runs as a console application. Every operating system provided by .NET Core should be able running it. 
However, the code is written on Windows 10 with an Intel i5 CPU and this is the Little Endian / Big Endian decision for the .NET Core environment for for my test. You simply build it via the DotNet tool or installing the Visual Studio Community Edtion 2019.
